use rgn.backend-architect agent to design a microservices architecture for a order processing 
system based in 3 services: exityorder, payment, inventory. All 
services are java services based on Spring Boot. Order uses 
Hexagonal Architecture Pattern, payment and inventory are 
designed based on Vertical Slice pattern. We Follow the single 
database per service principle. Order service should implement 
the SAGA design pattern based on compensating transactions 
pattern. When one transaction finishes successfully, Order 
emmits a specific event for that transaction. Order Service 
Uses Postgres, payment and inventory uses Mongo DB.

We are developing an MVP1 so will defer the following features:

- Payment gateway integration. Payment service won't integrate with external Payment Gateway at this moment. We'll use record the payment transactions in payment service DB.

- Order API Gateway integration

- AVRO serialization for Kafka. We'll use plain JSON for now.

- Security integration.


Record this as Key Decisions in Architecture Document as deferred to MVP2. We'll place specific ADR's if we change this in future.
